# Vagrant-Project

Given a node (use Vagrant), setup SSH with best security practices
(public/private, disable root login, allow restricted users etc). Then
install MySQL on it, configure root password and create new user on
it. Also setup Apache Web Server on it and serve a php file with
phpinfo().
